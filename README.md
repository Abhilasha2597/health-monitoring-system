Health Monitoring System
Using a Raspberry Pi 3B, a smart patient health monitoring system enables medical staff to keep an eye on patients' health in real time. To assess the patient's physiological data, the system employs a Raspberry Pi 3B as the primary controller and several sensors. The DHT11 thermal sensor, the MCP3008, the MAX 30102 pulse and heart sensors, and an OLED display are all examples of the sensors that may be utilized in the system.
The DHT11 sensor for temperature is used to monitor it and notify medical personnel. The data from MCP3008 is used for pulse sensors where data is displayed on OLED for real-time monitoring and can be used to assess a variety of physiological indicators. The rhythm of the heart, as well as oxygen saturation in the blood of the patient, can be tracked via sensors (MAX 30102). Medical professionals can be notified if any anomalies are found.
The system's primary controller, the Raspberry Pi 3B, enables communication with a variety of sensors and the processing of data collected from them.
Technical know-how and careful planning are needed to implement an effective health monitoring system utilizing the Raspberry Pi 3B. Calibrating sensors, processing and storing data, protecting data, managing power usage, and integrating systems are a few implementation issues that could come up. Despite these difficulties, an innovative healthcare monitoring system utilizing a Raspberry Pi 3 and sensors may be a useful tool for managing and monitoring patient health. Technology can provide real-time health information and assist with the early detection and treatment of a few medical disorders.
